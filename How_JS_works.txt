Everything in javascript happens inside an execution context

execution context :-
it has two components :-
    1. Memory components
        All the variables and functions are stored as key value pair
        1. key : value
            eg :- a:10, fn:{....}
    2. Code component :-
        Place where code is executed line by line

javascript is a synchronous single-threaded language.

javascript can only execute one command at a time and in a specific order
